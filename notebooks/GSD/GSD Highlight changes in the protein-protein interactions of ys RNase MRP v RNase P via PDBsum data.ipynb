I could have computationally generated the combinations; however, that way several will not be actually relevant and so instead of sorting out which ones actually return an 'empty' list of interactions for both structures from PDBsum (which shouldn't be too hard and could be added so down the road one could just supply two PDB code ids and let all the reports get generated, plus note that it has to be emptry for both structures because if one has none and the other has some like Pop1p[chain B] and Pop5p[chain E] that interact in Rnase P but not in RNase MRP, this is definitely important differences to catch; just to not the flip side of that is that in Rnase MRP Pop1p gains interactions with Rmp1[chain L] and Pop4p[Chain D] not seen in RNase P), I just decided to construct it myself so nothing is missed due to an error in handling the steps for doing it that way. Plus certain combinations were originally the impetus for this effort and so those were actuall added first and then I expanded out to check the other interactions."
