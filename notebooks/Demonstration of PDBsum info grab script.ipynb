    "This largely builds on the notebook [Demonstration of PDBsum ligand interface data to dataframe script](Demonstration%20of%20PDBsum%20ligand%20interface%20data%20to%20dataframe%20script.ipynb) and extends it to get some more general information about the experimentally-determined structure besides the ligand to help guide an answer to Biostars post [How to get specific information from a list of PDB ID and save all in a spreadsheet?](https://www.biostars.org/p/9515231/#9515231). As dicussed in there, because this isn't derived data, there's no reason in particular to use PDBsum for extracting this information. PDBfinder database may be better; however, for getting derived data, I already had the pipeline working with PDBsum and it was just a matter of adapting a couple scripts to get some details associated with the structures that are also listed at other places such as the Protein Data Bank, [the OCA Database and Browse](http://oca.weizmann.ac.il/oca-bin/ocamain), or Proteopedia.\n",
