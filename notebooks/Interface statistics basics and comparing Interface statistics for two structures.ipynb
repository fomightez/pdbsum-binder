For example, [6kiz](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/cgi-bin/pdbsum/GetPage.pl?pdbcode=6kiz&template=interfaces.html&c=999) doesn't show chains C and K interacting, see row `C:K` above. In both structures, chain C is histone H2A and chain K is KMT2A, and so it isn't that they represent different chains. While the data in the 6kiz structure has seven less residues experimentally observed for chain C, the interactions in 6kiv don't involve those residues, and so the 'missing residues' don't account for this interactions loss. Clearly, the structures differ in regards to this interaction.\n",
